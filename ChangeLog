------------------- Upcoming version 4.0 -----------------------------


------------------- Released version 3.0 -----------------------------

Command line tools
- Added the command line tool extrap-modeler to create a Extra-P
  experiment file with input data and models on a shell.
- Refactored extrap-print to produce a console output of an Extra-P
  experiment file. Removed the 95% confidence interval from the
  extrap-print output. Added additional options to get a list of
  definitions.

Multi-parameter support
- Added possibility to open set of CUBE files with multiple
  parameters. The number of parameters can be specified before loading
  the CUBE files. After a change to the number of parameters, it tries to
  guess the structure of the measurement directories.
- Added a model generator for multi-parameter models. Depending whether
  the experiment contains only one parameter or multiple parameters, the
  single-parameter model generators or the multi-parameter model generator
  can be selected for model generation.
- Several new displays for two-parameter models:
    - A display that plots selected models next to each other in distinct
      surface plots
    - A display that plots all selected models in the same surface plot
    - A scatter plot that shows for each parameter only the dominating
      function
    - The dominating model as the surface plot
    - The dominating model as a heat map
    - contour plots
    - interpolated contour plots
    - All selected models in the same surface plot with transparent
      surface and measurement points.
- Added projection possibilities. Thus, when more parameters are available
  than the display can handle, it shows a orthogonal projection.
  The user can choose which parameter is shown on which axis and the value
  for the remaining parameters.

Minor improvements and fixes
- Fixed Opening of experiment files which contain a model generated
  with the refining model generator.
- Allow to pass an Extra-P experiment file to the GUI via command line
  argument. The file is then opened on startup of the GUI.

------------------- Released version 2.0 -----------------------------

- Created custom GUI in python which replaces the usage of the
  CUBE GUI with plug-ins
- Added command line tool to output the content of Extra-P files.
- A refactored version of the single parameter modeler from version 1.0.
  It requires a manual definition of the model search space
- Added a new modeler that iteratively refined its modeling space and,
  thus, do not need a manual configured modeling space beforehand.
- Added a custom format to load and store perfromance models.
- Support for data input via a set of CUBE files contained in a directory.
  The measurement directories containing the CUBE files need to have
  a uniform format. The GUI tries to automatically detect the prefix name,
  the name of the parameter, the parameter values and the number of
  repetitons.
- Improved robustness against calltree variations during CUBE data import.
- Support for data input in a human readable text format.
- An experiment can contain multiple models. The user can switch between
  the models, create additional models or delete models.
